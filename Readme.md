# Speech-Recognition
The goal of this project is to develop and integrate a voice control adapted to subjects with different language disabilities (dystrophy, paralysis, etc.) and for clearly speaking subjects. The algorithm need to be robust against noise environments. In this way, the project is decomposed into several sub algorithms (Vocal Activity Detection Algorithm, Training Model, CNN, Support Vector Machine with GMM supervisors, etc.).
The project is not yet finished, the files will be added.
